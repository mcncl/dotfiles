## Terminal
[Warp](https://warp.dev) is an awesome terminal that runs a little different to others. Has things like [Fig](https://fig.io) built in.

The theme in [warp/themes](warp/themes) is a custom Warp theme based on [gruvbox-material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material).

Warp tends to use a darker shade for the "focus" pane, so I've adjusted the colouring of that pane to match the hex code of the gruvbox-material theme. This means, when using Warp, there isn't a "border" around Nvim that is darker than the Nvim "window".
